Tea/Camera App

Reviewer 1

This is really excellent code. The application runs smoothly in my emulator, and is pleasing to look at. Good use of white space to indent code which is describing an object or function declared above it which has not been terminated yet. There is a bit of excessive line breaking, which depending on your style of organization may be the best option, I just found it to be a waste of screen real estate. Additionally, I would always recommend naming variables of any sort, with a descriptive name, so you know exactly what it is for. This was done for the tea portion of the app, as well as the camera, but was not done for the environmental variables like navigation buttons and windows. Also, comments are an invaluable tool, it would be nice to see them used a bit more.
